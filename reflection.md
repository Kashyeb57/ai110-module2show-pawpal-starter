# PawPal+ Project Reflection

## 1. System Design

**a. Initial design**

Three core user actions:

1. **Add/manage a pet profile** — The user enters basic owner info (name, available time per day) and pet info (name, type/species). This sets the context and constraints for scheduling.
2. **Add/edit care tasks** — The user creates tasks such as walks, feeding, medication, grooming, or enrichment. Each task has at minimum a name, duration (in minutes), and priority level (high/medium/low).
3. **Generate and view a daily plan** — The user triggers the scheduler, which selects and orders tasks that fit within the owner's available time, ranked by priority. The app displays the resulting schedule and explains why tasks were included or excluded.

Five classes were designed:

- **Owner**: Responsible for storing who the owner is and how much daily time they have for pet care. Holds `name`, `available_minutes`, `preferences`, and a list of `pets`. Methods: `add_pet()`, `get_available_time()`.
- **Pet**: Represents the animal being cared for. Holds `name`, `species`, `age`, a back-reference to `owner`, and a list of `tasks`. Method: `get_info()`.
- **Task**: Represents a single care activity. Holds `name`, `task_type`, `duration_minutes`, `priority`, `is_completed`, and `reason_skipped`. Method: `mark_complete()`.
- **Scheduler**: The core logic engine. Takes an `Owner`, a `Pet`, and a list of `Tasks`, and produces a `DailyPlan`. Methods: `generate_plan()`, `prioritize_tasks()`, `fits_within_time()`.
- **DailyPlan**: The output of the scheduler. Holds `scheduled_tasks`, `skipped_tasks`, `total_duration`, and `date`. Methods: `display()`, `explain_reasoning()`.

**b. Design changes**

After an AI review of the skeleton, three issues were identified and fixed:

1. **`Pet` was missing a `tasks` list** — The original design only stored tasks on the `Scheduler`. This created a missing direct relationship between a pet and its care tasks. A `tasks: list[Task]` field was added to `Pet` so the pet directly owns its tasks, matching the UML intent.
2. **`Owner.pets` was untyped** — Changed from `list` to `list[Pet]` for type safety and clarity.
3. **`Task` was missing `reason_skipped`** — `DailyPlan.explain_reasoning()` needs to explain why tasks were skipped, but there was nowhere on the task to store that reason. Added `reason_skipped: Optional[str]` to `Task`.

## 2. Scheduling Logic and Tradeoffs

**a. Constraints and priorities**

The scheduler considers two constraints: total available time (owner's daily budget in minutes) and task priority (high/medium/low). Within the same priority level, it uses duration as a tiebreaker — shorter tasks are scheduled first to maximise the number of tasks that fit. Priority was chosen as the primary constraint because skipping a high-priority task (like medication) is more harmful than skipping a low-priority one (like enrichment).

**b. Tradeoffs**

The conflict detector only flags tasks that share the same `task_type` (e.g. two "feeding" tasks), rather than checking for overlapping time windows. This means it catches logical duplicates (feeding a pet twice in one plan) but does not detect time-based overlaps if tasks were assigned explicit start times. This tradeoff is reasonable for this scenario because PawPal+ does not schedule tasks at fixed times — it only builds an ordered list. A lightweight type-based check is sufficient and avoids the complexity of a full interval-overlap algorithm.
